The Network Adapter Class Extension to WDF (NetAdapterCx) brings together the productivity of WDF with the networking performance of NDIS. The goal of NetAdpaterCx is to make it easy to write a great driver for your NIC.

This repository hosts code you can include into your own NIC driver, based on NetAdapterCx.

## The RTL8168D Sample Driver

This is a complete, working driver for the `PCI\VEN_10EC&DEV_8168&SUBSYS_816810EC&REV_03` device.
The device is based on the PCI bus, uses bus-mastering DMA to transfer data, and uses line-based interrupts.
The hardware supports checksum offload, interupt moderation, and several Wake-on-LAN patterns.
